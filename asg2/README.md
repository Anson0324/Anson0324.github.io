For this blocky animal assignment, I made a sheep that accidentally stepped onto a cactus, in addtional:

1. I colored the sheep very nicely.
2. I animated all legs along with the hoofs.
3. I made the cactus serve as the third joint.
4. I used cylinders as legs and cone as cactus.
5. The sheep goes panic if you hold shift and click.
6. I added the mouse control.
7. I optimized the performance and added the performance indicator.
